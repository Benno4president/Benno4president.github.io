        <h3>1. Care of the Earth</h3>
        <p>This principle is all about looking after the planet that keeps us alive.
            The Earth provides everything we need; air, water, food, and shelter.
            Since it's the only source of these essentials, it's common sense to take care of it.
            Everything on Earth, from the soil and plants to rivers and animals, is connected.
            By keeping ecosystems healthy, we're essentially looking after ourselves.
            This includes taking care of the soil, which supports all plant life and preserving forests,
            which clean our air and help regulate the water cycle.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/ethics.png" width="69%" align="right"></p>

        <h3>2. Care of People</h3>
        <p>This principle emphasizes the importance of taking care of each other
            and creating strong, supportive communities. Humans are social creatures
            and just like bees or ants, we rely on each other to thrive.
            It's the idea of “teach a person to fish,” so we all benefit long-term.
            A key point here is that you can't help others if you're not taking care
            of yourself first. So, this principle starts with self-care and extends outward,
            from family to neighbors, then to the broader community
            and eventually to the world.</p>

        <h3>3. Fair Share</h3>
        <p>The Fair Share principle is about understanding that there are only
            so many resources to go around, so it's important to take only what
            you need and share the rest. Our modern consumer culture pushes
            for constant growth and more consumption, but that doesn't work
            in a world with limited resources. Instead, permaculture encourages
            us to recognize when we have more than we need and to give
            back; whether that is sharing food, skills, or time.</p>

        <h3>1. Observe and Interact</h3>
        <p> observant and responding to what we see is really important in
            moving towards a more ethical and sustainable way of life.
            Be observant of the location; Know what thrives and which animals
            that use the space and how they interact with the ecosystem.
            Go with the flow and do not recreate in your own image. Watch all
            seasons - everything changes. Know the rain cycles and the suns trajectory.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp2.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>2. Catch and Store Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Energy is abundant on our planet. Learning how to catch and store that
            energy - in plants, with renewable energy infrastructure, or in other
            ways, is key to living a sustainable way of life. Energy is power,
            heat, calories, seeds and rain. Preserve as much food as possible.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp3.gif" width="20%" align="left"></p>
        <h3>3. Obtain a Yield</h3>
        <p>
            Get rewarede for your work. Obtaining a yield can be as simple as
            using organic gardening techniques to provide food for our families
            - but it can also be about obtaining a non-tangible yield:
            happiness, health, trading, skills and knowledge. Chickens produces
            eggs and meat, scratches between crops, feeds off food scraps,
            generates manure and provides happieness.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp4.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>4. Apply Self-Regulation and Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding where we've succeeded and where we've gone wrong is
            vitally important to creating real and lasting change.
            Do not abuse a system, learn how far to push it without going
            too far. Listen to the feedback that is given to us.
            Also applies to overwork - happieness is important too.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp5.gif" width="20%" align="left"></p>
        <h3>5. Use and Value Renewables</h3>
        <p>
            By using the power of the sun, the wind, or the water, we can
            power our homes, grow our food, and regenerate our environments.
            Use animals instead of machines and let nature run its course.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp6.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>6. Produce No Waste</h3>
        <p>
            Moving towards a zero waste lifestyle means looking at all the
            trash we chuck out and trying to eliminate it. We can do this
            by reducing the amount we buy, by buying wisely, by reusing or
            recycling where possible, by composting, and by working with
            ethical companies who look at waste throughout the entire
            life-cycle of their products.
        </p>
        <p><img src="static/perma/pp7.gif" width="20%" align="left"></p>
        <h3>7. Design from Patterns to Details</h3>
        <p>
            Nature works in patterns. Used for space optimization and used
            correctly, it can enchance the plants. Rows are bad and
            inefficient - nature has diversity, moisture-retention,
            supportive plants and animal ecosystems. Think about sun and
            shade control and make incorborate workstations and places to be happy.
        </p>

        <p><img src="static/perma/pp8.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>8. Integrate Don't Segregate</h3>
        <p>
            Plants work well in diverse systems - the same is true of people too.
            Plant polycultures (guilds of plants which work together). We can
            also apply it to communities, groups or organisations. Also: you do
            not have a surplus of snails - you have a deficit of ducks (or geese).
            Remember to integrate into the community by trading, selling,
            building or teaching.
        </p>

        <p><img src="static/perma/pp9.gif" width="20%" align="left"></p>
        <h3>9. Use Small, Slow Solutions</h3>
        <p> small, incremental changes is the best way to move towards sustainable change. Fast solutions are rarely the
            best and carries more risk. For example - don't start a farm, try a small windowsill garden. Don't overhaul
            your entire shopping philosophy - change things one ethical purchase at a time. Use materials sources local
            and cheap/free to build, don't rush it.
        </p>

        <p><img src="static/perma/pp10.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>10. Use and Value Diversity</h3>
        <p>Just as ecosystems work best when filled with a greater variety of different plants and animals, so human
            society functions best when an variety of different people are represented. In your garden, home and your
            life in general, it's a good idea to promote and value diversity in all its forms. Don't put all your eggs
            in one basket. Diversity lowers all kinds of risk. Plant flowers, herbs and medicinal perennials around
            veggies and fruit trees, and see the pollinators and insect predators flourish.
        </p>

        <p><img src="static/perma/pp11.gif" width="20%" align="left"></p>
        <h3>11. Use Edges and Value the Marginal</h3>
        <p>Sustainability is about making use of all the resources that we have at our disposal. Whether we're talking
            about land use, work places, homes or society. This might be as simple as using a neglected corner of your
            outside space to grow more food, or something more abstract, like thinking outside the box. The proverb
            “don't think you are on the right track just because its a well-beaten path” reminds us that the most
            popular is not necessarily the best approach.
        </p>

        <p><img src="static/perma/pp12.gif" width="20%" align="right"></p>
        <h3>12. Creatively Use and Respond to Change</h3>
        <p>It's important to remember that permaculture isn't just about now, but about the future. We design for
            change, understanding that things will alter over time. The changing seasons, changing attitudes, our
            changing climate. Interaction between the young and the elderly provides a way in which knowledge and
            experience can be passed on to the next generation.

        <div class="card">Soil</div>
        <p><img src="static/perma/nitrogen-cycle.png" width="85%" align="right"></p>
        <p>
            secret to healthy soil is to mimic nature and create a living ecosystem of microorganisms, plants, and
            animals that keep the soil healthy. The soil stores carbon using biomass and fungi growth which is released
            when the soil is tilled.
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Work with Nature
            <br>
            Different environments like forests and grasslands have different soil types. Forest soils are rich in
            fungi,
            while grasslands have a balance of fungi and bacteria. Choose the right approach based on what type of
            system
            you're trying to create.
            <br>
            2. Avoid Heavy Tilling
            <br>
            Tilling can harm the soil by breaking its structure and killing helpful organisms. Instead, let worms and
            other
            creatures naturally aerate and fertilize the soil.
            <br>
            3. Add Organic Matter
            <br>
            Organic material is key to building healthy soil. Use compost, mulch, and crop leftovers to improve soil in
            gardens. In grasslands and food forests, use cover crops and organic mulch for long-term health.
            <br>
            4. Use Compost and Mulch
            <br>
            Compost provides nutrients and introduces good microbes. Mulch keeps the soil protected, retains moisture,
            and
            slowly breaks down to feed the soil.
            <br>
            5. Plant Cover Crops
            <br>
            Cover crops keep the soil covered, prevent erosion, and add nutrients. Legume plants like clover help fix
            nitrogen in the soil, which is essential for plant growth.
            <br>
        <p><img src="static/perma/mycorrhiza.png" width="65%" align="left"></p>
        6. Encourage Fungi
        <br>
        In forest-like systems, promote fungi by using woody materials and adding fungi to the soil. Fungi help
        plant roots absorb nutrients and fight diseases. Mycorrhiza is a special relationship between fungi and plant
        roots that benefits both. The fungi attach to the plant roots and extend far into the soil, helping the plant
        absorb more water and nutrients, especially phosphorus. In return, the plant provides the fungi with sugars and
        nutrients it produces through photosynthesis. This partnership is very important because it improves the plant's
        ability to grow in poor soils, helps prevent
        diseases, and even increases resistance to drought. Mycorrhizae also create a network that connects plants,
        allowing them to share nutrients and communicate through chemical signals. Mycorrhiza can be bought and added
        to a soil system.
        <br>
        7. Include Animals
        <br>
        Animals like grazing livestock help the soil by trampling it and adding natural fertilizer. Rotating animals
        through different areas improves soil structure over time.

        <p>
        <h4>Zone 0:</h4>
        This is the heart of the permaculture design, typically where the home or main living space is located. It's the
        hub of daily activities, where energy and water use are most intensive.

        <h4>Zone 1:</h4>
        This area is immediately surrounding the home. It's frequently visited and is the site of activities that
        require regular attention, like herb gardens, salad crops, or small livestock like chickens.

        <h4>Zone 2:</h4>
        Zone 2 encompasses the space for more extensive orchards, larger fruiting shrubs, and other plants or animals
        that require moderate levels of attention.

        <h4>Zone 3:</h4>
        This is the primary agricultural zone, where main crops are grown, both for consumption and sale. Large-scale
        plantings, orchards, and larger livestock reside here.

        <h4>Zone 4:</h4>
        Semi-managed, this zone often comprises of foraging areas, managed woodlands for timber and firewood, and some
        grazing for livestock. It's a bridge between cultivated land and wild ecosystems.

        <h4>Zone 5:</h4>
        The wilderness. This zone is left mostly untouched to foster biodiversity and provide a natural habitat for
        wildlife. It acts as a reservoir of wild plants and animals and serves as a reminder of the natural ecosystems
        that permaculture seeks to emulate.

        <h3>Sectors</h3>
        <p>
            Sector planning is concerned with energies external to our site, the elements and forces of Nature, that
            come from outside our system, and pass through it.
            These energies include
            hot summer winds,
            cold winter winds,
            winter and summer sun angles,
            salty or damaging winds,
            water flow and flood prone areas,
            unwanted views
            and fire danger areas.
            <br>

            Since these wild energies come into our system from outside, we can strategically place elements in our
            design to manage or take advantage of these incoming energies. By placing plants, trees or structures in the
            appropriate areas, we can block the incoming energy, channel the incoming energy for our intended use and
            open the area to allow the incoming energy.

        <div class="card">Water</div>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRvatpQA_Y">Water video</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://permacultureapprentice.com/permaculture-water-management/">Water in-depth article</a></p>
        <p>
            Water is the foundation of any successful permaculture system. Effective water management the
            top priority in permaculture. Whether through harvesting rainwater, storing it in the soil, or collecting
            surface water, the goal is to maximize water availability on the farm.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two primary strategies for water conservation: storing water in the soil and diverting surface
            water to ponds, dams, or tanks. The first step is to "slow, spread, and sink" rainwater into the soil as
            much as possible. This helps prevent runoff and allows the water to infiltrate deeply, increasing the
            water-holding capacity of the soil. Once the soil has absorbed as much water as it can, any runoff can be
            stored on the surface for later use.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ben Falk, in Resilient Farm and Homestead, outlines three key objectives: (1) capture as much water as
            possible, (2) store that water for dry periods, and (3) distribute it across the site when needed. Your
            approach will depend on the specific conditions of your farm, including climate, terrain, soil type, and
            overall water needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            To start, you need to understand your water sources. The first and most important question is: how much
            precipitation does your farm receive annually? You also need to know how that rainfall is distributed
            throughout the year; whether it comes in heavy downpours or is spread evenly. This will inform how you
            design
            your water systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to rain, streams and underground water can also be valuable resources. Streams on or near your
            property may provide a reliable water source, but you'll need to determine whether they are perennial or
            seasonal. If you're considering tapping into groundwater, you may need to drill a well.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you've assessed your water sources, the next step is to analyze your watershed. A watershed is the area
            of land that drains water to a common point, like a stream or river. Your farm is part of a larger
            watershed, and understanding its topography will help you predict how water moves across your land. Using
            topographic maps, you can identify ridges, valleys, and other features that affect water flow. This will
            allow you to calculate your watershed area and, ultimately, your total rainfall volume.
            <br>
            <br>
            Storing water in the soil is one of the most cost-effective and efficient methods. The goal is to increase
            the soil's organic matter, which acts like a sponge, absorbing and holding water. Even a small increase in
            organic matter can significantly reduce the need for irrigation. Techniques like keyline plowing and swales
            can further enhance water infiltration.
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><img src="static/perma/swales.jpg" width="100%" align="right"></p>
            Swales are a popular method for storing water in the soil. A swale is a ditch dug along the contour of
            the land that captures runoff, allowing it to percolate into the soil. The water stored in a swale creates a
            reservoir of moisture that supports plant growth, particularly trees, even during dry periods. Swales can
            also prevent erosion and create a rich layer of humus in the ditch, which further increases the soil's
            ability to hold water.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you've maximized water storage in the soil, surface storage in ponds or tanks becomes the next focus.
            If your water needs are relatively small or you need a potable water source, a tank might be the best
            option. For larger volumes of water, ponds or dams are more effective. Ponds can serve multiple purposes,
            from irrigation to aquaculture, while also providing habitat for wildlife.
            <br>
            <br>
            After setting up your water storage systems, you'll need to think about how to harvest water. Diversion
            drains and swales can be used to channel water into ponds or tanks. Roads and other impervious surfaces can
            also serve as efficient water-harvesting systems, collecting runoff that can be redirected into your
            storage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Irrigation is another important consideration. Gravity-fed systems, where water is released from a pond or
            tank through pipes, can be used to irrigate fields, orchards, or gardens. This method is especially
            effective if the water source is positioned at a high point on your property, allowing water to flow
            naturally downhill.
