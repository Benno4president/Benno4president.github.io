        <div class="card">Ethics</div>


        <h3>1. Care of the Earth</h3>
        <p>This principle is all about looking after the planet that keeps us alive.
            The Earth provides everything we need; air, water, food, and shelter.
            Since it's the only source of these essentials, it's common sense to take care of it.
            Everything on Earth, from the soil and plants to rivers and animals, is connected.
            By keeping ecosystems healthy, we're essentially looking after ourselves.
            This includes taking care of the soil, which supports all plant life and preserving forests,
            which clean our air and help regulate the water cycle.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Care of People</h3>
        <p>This principle emphasizes the importance of taking care of each other
            and creating strong, supportive communities. Humans are social creatures
            and just like bees or ants, we rely on each other to thrive.
            It's the idea of “teach a person to fish,” so we all benefit long-term.
            A key point here is that you can't help others if you're not taking care
            of yourself first. So, this principle starts with self-care and extends outward,
            from family to neighbors, then to the broader community
            and eventually to the world.</p>

        <h3>3. Fair Share</h3>
        <p>The Fair Share principle is about understanding that there are only
            so many resources to go around, so it's important to take only what
            you need and share the rest. Our modern consumer culture pushes
            for constant growth and more consumption, but that doesn't work
            in a world with limited resources. Instead, permaculture encourages
            us to recognize when we have more than we need and to give
            back; whether that is sharing food, skills, or time.</p>

        <h3>1. Observe and Interact</h3>

        <p> observant and responding to what we see is really important in
            moving towards a more ethical and sustainable way of life.
            Be observant of the location; Know what thrives and which animals
            that use the space and how they interact with the ecosystem.
            Go with the flow and do not recreate in your own image. Watch all
            seasons - everything changes. Know the rain cycles and the suns trajectory.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Catch and Store Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Energy is abundant on our planet. Learning how to catch and store that
            energy - in plants, with renewable energy infrastructure, or in other
            ways, is key to living a sustainable way of life. Energy is power,
            heat, calories, seeds and rain. Preserve as much food as possible.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Obtain a Yield</h3>
        <p>
            Get rewarede for your work. Obtaining a yield can be as simple as
            using organic gardening techniques to provide food for our families
            - but it can also be about obtaining a non-tangible yield:
            happiness, health, trading, skills and knowledge. Chickens produces
            eggs and meat, scratches between crops, feeds off food scraps,
            generates manure and provides happieness.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Apply Self-Regulation and Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding where we've succeeded and where we've gone wrong is
            vitally important to creating real and lasting change.
            Do not abuse a system, learn how far to push it without going
            too far. Listen to the feedback that is given to us.
            Also applies to overwork - happieness is important too.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Use and Value Renewables</h3>
        <p>
            By using the power of the sun, the wind, or the water, we can
            power our homes, grow our food, and regenerate our environments.
            Use animals instead of machines and let nature run its course.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Produce No Waste</h3>
        <p>
            Moving towards a zero waste lifestyle means looking at all the
            trash we chuck out and trying to eliminate it. We can do this
            by reducing the amount we buy, by buying wisely, by reusing or
            recycling where possible, by composting, and by working with
            ethical companies who look at waste throughout the entire
            life-cycle of their products.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Design from Patterns to Details</h3>
        <p>
            Nature works in patterns. Used for space optimization and used
            correctly, it can enchance the plants. Rows are bad and
            inefficient - nature has diversity, moisture-retention,
            supportive plants and animal ecosystems. Think about sun and
            shade control and make incorborate workstations and places to be happy.
