        <h3>Ethics</h3>

        
        <p>1. Care of the Earth</p>
        <p>This principle is all about looking after the planet that keeps us alive. 
            The Earth provides everything we need; air, water, food, and shelter. 
            Since it's the only source of these essentials, it's common sense to take care of it. 
            Everything on Earth, from the soil and plants to rivers and animals, is connected. 
            By keeping ecosystems healthy, we're essentially looking after ourselves. 
            This includes taking care of the soil, which supports all plant life and preserving forests, 
            which clean our air and help regulate the water cycle.

        <p></p>2. Care of People</p>
        <p>This principle emphasizes the importance of taking care of each other and creating strong, supportive communities. Humans are social creatures, and just like bees or ants, we rely on each other to thrive. No one can do everything alone, and the idea of total self-sufficiency is a myth. Instead, we focus on self-reliance—learning skills, sharing knowledge, and working together to meet our needs. It's the idea of “teach a person to fish,” so we all benefit long-term. A key point here is that you can’t help others if you’re not taking care of yourself first. So, this principle starts with self-care and extends outward, from family to neighbors, then to the broader community, and eventually to the world at large. When people collaborate, share, and support one another, it builds healthier, happier communities.</p>
        
        <p>3. Fair Share</p>
        <p>The Fair Share principle is about understanding that there are only so many resources to go around, so it’s important to take only what you need and share the rest. Our modern consumer culture pushes for constant growth and more consumption, but that doesn’t work in a world with limited resources. Instead, permaculture encourages us to recognize when we have more than we need and to give back—whether that’s sharing food, skills, or time. It’s a shift from hoarding resources to living more in balance with nature and each other. In traditional societies, people understood the need for balance—only taking what they needed so resources were available for future generations. Fair Share helps build more equitable communities and preserves the environment for the long term.</p>
