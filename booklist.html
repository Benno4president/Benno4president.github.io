                This is not my full booklist, but merely those i cared to write down because i was pretty sure i would forget all about them. Books not included are all related to my profession as i would like to forget about those once read. If any have spilled into this list its probably because they are not just good but 10/10. I'll also write reviews if and when i care to.
